"CORESHIELD,40",Self Shielded Flux Cored Wires (FCAW),Mild Steel Wires,"Coreshield 40 is a self-shielded flux cored wire primarily designed for multiple pass, horizontal and flat position welding of low and medium carbon steels when toughness is not a requirement. The larger sizes achieve very high deposit rates for very low joining costs. The low penetration, convex fillet bead shape and ability for the slag to desulfurize the deposit make it an ideal choice when crack resistance is a primary consideration. The flat position deposits are smooth and uniform with good wetting into the side walls. The core ingredients are carefully balanced to stabilize the droplet transfer, enhance the ability to handle mill scale and easily detach the slag for quick cleaning. Coreshield 40 is designed to operate on DCEP (electrode positive) with longer electrical stickout. The longer extension increases the deposit potential by preheating the wire.","Industries,Welding Process","Railcars,Industrial and General Fabrication,Civil Construction,Welding-FCAW - Flux Core Arc Welding","Typical Tensile Properties,Condition,Elongation,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,P,Mn,S,C,Si,Al,Deposition Data,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Efficiency (%),Electrical Stickout,Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Classifications: ","As Welded,29 %,86 ksi,62 ksi,0.012 %,0.30 %,0.007 %,0.20 %,0.30 %,1.30 %,5/64 in.,2.0 mm,

"Coreshield,15",Self Shielded Flux Cored Wires (FCAW),Mild Steel Wires,"Coreshield 15 is an all-position self-shielded flux cored welding wire for single pass applications. Coreshield 15 produces smooth arc action, full slag coverage, easy slag removal, and low spatter. The use of DCEN (electrode negative) current minimizes the risk of burn-through. Coreshield 15 is excellent for use on lap and fillet welds on thin gauge galvanized and mild steels in all welding positions. The availability of .030"" (0.8 mm) diameter makes it possible to use this product on materials as thin as 18 gauge (1.2 mm). The wire is particularly suitable for thin gauge materials 0.030 - 3/16"" (0.8-5.0 in.) in galvanised, zinc-aluminum carbon, or aluminised carbon steels. In structural fabrications, the product can be used where no seismic requirements are present.",,,"Typical Tensile Properties,Condition,Tensile Strength,Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,P,Mn,C,S,Si,Al,Deposition Data,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Efficiency (%),Electrical Stickout,TTW Dist.,Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Deposition Data,Full Range,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Efficiency (%),Electrical Stickout,TTW Dist.,Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Classifications: ,Alloy Type: ,Welding Current: ","As Welded,89 ksi,0.01 %,0.70 %,0.23 %,0.01 %,0.40 %,2 %,.045 in.,1.2 mm,

"NICORE,55",Metal Cored Wire (MCAW),Cast Iron Wires,"Nicore 55 is a composite metal cored wire for repair and joining of cast iron materials. The deposit, which is approximately 53% iron and 45% nickel, provides an excellent match for the coefficient of expansion exhibited by cast irons. Cracking is minimized because thermal stresses caused by the heat of welding are minimized. The light slag is easily removed enhancing visual weld inspection. The fact that this is a continuous electrode will improve the operating factor and minimize unnecessary stops and starts. This electrode can replace covered electrodes such as AWS ENiFe-Cl or ENiFe-Cl-A. It may be used for repair welds or for joining various types of cast irons. Cast irons may be welded to steel and other ferrous and non-ferrous materials with this product. The machinability of the weld deposit is comparable to the matching covered electrode.~Substantial savings in weld metal deposition costs will be realized when replacing 55% nickel coated electrodes with Nicore 55. The deposition rate of this wire is more than twice that of a comparable coated electrode. The efficiency (approximately 97%) compared to that of coated electrodes (56% assuming 3"" stub loss) is substantially greater. These two factors result in substantial savings in weld metal deposition costs. Because of the high deposition rate, the travel rate is very fast, resulting in lower heat input which is advantageous in welding cast irons.",Welding Process,Welding-MCAW - Metal Core Arc Welding,"Typical Tensile Properties,Condition,Elongation,Hardness (BHN),Tensile Strength,Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,Mn,C,Si,Ni,Al,Deposition Data,98% Ar - 2% O2,Diameter,Current,Voltage,Alloy Type: ,Welding Current: ","As Welded,12 %,187 BHN,72 ksi,0.23 %,1.04 %,0.71 %,45.3 %,0.01 %,.045 in.,1.2 mm,

"COREWELD,C6,LF",Metal Cored Wire (MCAW),Mild Steel Wires,"Coreweld C6 LF is a low manganese emissions, high efficiency, metal cored wire developed in response to new EPA* regulations and guidelines from ACGIH (American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists) for Manganese fume exposure limits. With all the same enhanced features of ESAB’s standard Coreweld C6, Coreweld C6 LF has more than 50 percent lower manganese content and is designed to provide excellent operating qualities while significantly reducing the manganese levels in the welding fumes when compared to standard metal-cored electrodes of the same classification. ESAB’s optimized formulation aids users in their efforts to reduce exposure to manganese in the welding environment while providing good mechanical properties and low weld metal diffusible hydrogen levels. Coreweld C6 LF offers the same enhanced features of ESAB’s standard Coreweld C6 with welder-friendly operating characteristics, including consistent arc stability, very low spatter, good bead shape and minimal clean-up in an easy-to-use wire. Its low diffusible hydrogen level helps avoid hydrogen-induced cold cracking in the welding of high strength steel. Combining the Coreweld C6 LF low manganese formula with argon-based shielding gases and GMAW power supplies allows users to aggressively reduce the manganese concentration in welding fume while achieving the proven performance expected from ESAB, Coreweld C6 LF is well suited for both hand held and robotic or automated applications in the automotive industry, as well as for civil construction, mobile and heavy equipment, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, and general fabrication.

"COREWELD,88HS,Ni1",Metal Cored Wire (MCAW),Mild Steel Wires,"Coreweld 88HS-Ni1 is recommended primarily for robotic or mechanized high speed welding of sheet steel. Welding speeds up to 90 ipm are possible when welding vertical down. The low slag level of Coreweld 88HS-Ni1 minimizes post weld clean up. For this reason, Coreweld 88HS-Ni1 gives special advantage in applications where post weld coating or painting is specified. Coreweld 88HS-Ni1 is a 1% nickel low alloy metal cored wire designed specifically for high speed welding where a clean weld surface is required. Coreweld 88HS-Ni1 deposits have very few silicon islands and almost no slag at the weld toes.","Industries,Welding Process","Industrial and General Fabrication,Railcars,Power Poles,Welding-MCAW - Metal Core Arc Welding","Typical Tensile Properties,90% Ar - 10% CO,Condition,Elongation,Reduction in Area,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,75% Ar - 25% CO,Condition,Elongation,Reduction in Area,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,Typical Charpy V-Notch Properties,75% Ar - 25% CO,Condition,Impact Value,Testing Temperature,90% Ar - 10% CO,Condition,Impact Value,Testing Temperature,Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,P,Mn,S,C,Si,Ni,P,Mn,S,C,Si,Ni,Deposition Data,90% Ar - 10% CO,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Deposition Type,Efficiency (%),TTW Dist.,Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Deposition Data,75% Ar - 25% CO,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Deposition Type,Efficiency (%),TTW Dist.,Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Approvals: ,Classifications: ","

"COREWELD,70",Metal Cored Wire (MCAW),Mild Steel Wires,"Coreweld 70 is a tubular wire containing ingredients primarily comprised of metal powder along with additional arc stabilizers and alloying elements. The net result is a high efficiency (90 to 98%) wire. Arc characteristics, weld metal transfer, spatter levels are improved, while silica islands are minimized with the use of Argon mixtures up to 92% Argon. Due to the high level of iron powder and low slag components, the only slag formed by this wire are small islands of silica. Coreweld 70 was designed for multipass welding in robotic applications where slag removal between passes is difficult. This metal cored product is intended for use on carbon steels having tensile strengths up to 70 ksi (485 MPa). Coreweld 70 wires from .045"" up to 1/16"" are capable of being welded out-of-position.","Industries,Welding Process","Automotive,Mobile Equipment,Industrial and General Fabrication,Power Generation,Bridge Construction,Civil Construction,Pipeline,Ship/Barge Building,Railcars,Welding-MCAW - Metal Core Arc Welding","Typical Tensile Properties,75% Ar - 25% CO,Condition,Elongation,Reduction in Area,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,92% Ar - 8% CO,Condition,Elongation,Reduction in Area,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,Typical Charpy V-Notch Properties,75% Ar - 25% CO,Condition,Impact Value,Testing Temperature,92% Ar - 8% CO,Condition,Impact Value,Testing Temperature,Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,P,Mn,C,S,Si,P,Mn,C,S,Si,Deposition Data,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Deposition Type,Efficiency (%),TTW Dist.,Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Deposition Data,75% Ar - 25% CO,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Deposition Type,Efficiency (%),TTW Dist.,Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Approvals: ,Classifications: ","

"ARCALOY,MC308L",Metal Cored Wire (MCAW),Stainless Steel Wires,"Arcaloy MC308L is a composite metal cored stainless steel wire which has a stainless steel sheath. Arcaloy MC308L is used for welding types 301, 302, 304, and 304L. This may be used for welding types 321 and 347 if service temperatures do not exceed 500°F(260°C). Its higher deposition rate and less penetration compared to solid wire makes it very suitable for making butt, fillet and lap welds on gauge material. Higher speeds are also possible compared to solid wire. The low spatter and slag-free welds make this electrode ideal for automatic and robotic welding. The pushing technique can be used to further minimize the penetration and oxide film formed on the surface of the weld. Typical applications include automobile catalytic converters, manifolds, mufflers, exhaust systems. For welding in the spray mode of metal transfer, the shielding gas should be argon with 1 or 2% oxygen or carbon dioxide. Pulse welding can also be used to further minimize penetration in thin gauge steels. This metal cored wire can also be used in submerged arc welding in combination with 10.93 Flux.","Industries,Welding Process","Mobile Equipment,Pipeline,Ship/Barge Building,Industrial and General Fabrication,Automotive,Process,Welding-MCAW - Metal Core Arc Welding,Welding-SAW - Submerged Arc Welding,Welding-GMAW (MIG/MAG - Metal Inert Gas / Metal Active Gas)","Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,Mn,Mo,Cu,C,Si,Ferrite,Ni,Cr,Mn,Mo,Cu,C,Si,Ferrite,Ni,Cr,Deposition Data,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Efficiency (%),Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Classifications: ","1.50 %,0.10 %,0.10 %,0.03 %,0.55 %,10 FN %,10 %,20 %,1/16 in.,1.6 mm,

"ARCALOY,MC316L",Metal Cored Wire (MCAW),Stainless Steel Wires,"Arcaloy MC316L is a composite metal cored stainless steel wire which has a stainless steel sheath. The addition of molybdenum helps reduce pitting corrosion. As a small diameter cored wire it can be used for the welding of thin gauge 316, 316L and sometimes 304 and 304L stainless steels. Its higher deposition rate and less penetration compared to solid wire makes it very suitable for making butt, fillet and lap welds on gauge material. Higher speeds are also possible compared to solid wire. The low spatter and slag-free welds make this electrode ideal for automatic and robotic welding. The pushing technique can be used to further minimize the penetration and oxide film formed on the surface of the weld. Typical applications include automobile catalytic converters, manifolds, mufflers, exhaust systems. For welding in the spray mode of metal transfer, the shielding gas should be argon with 1 or 2% oxygen or carbon dioxide. Pulse welding can also be used to further minimize penetration in thin gauge steels. This metal cored wire can also be used in submerged arc welding. It can be used with ESAB OK 10.93 flux.","Industries,Welding Process","Mobile Equipment,Automotive,Pipeline,Ship/Barge Building,Industrial and General Fabrication,Welding-MCAW - Metal Core Arc Welding,Welding-SAW - Submerged Arc Welding,Welding-GMAW (MIG/MAG - Metal Inert Gas / Metal Active Gas)","Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,Mn,Mo,Cu,C,Si,Ferrite,Ni,Cr,Mn,Mo,Cu,C,Si,Ferrite,Ni,Cr,Deposition Data,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Efficiency (%),Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Classifications: ","1.40 %,2.70 %,0.10 %,0.02 %,0.50 %,7 FN %,12 %,18.50 %,1/16 in.,1.6 mm,

"DUAL,SHIELD,T-5",Gas Shielded Flux Cored Wires (FCAW),Mild Steel Wires,"Dual Shield T-5 is a basic slag flux cored wire that produces crack resistant, highly ductile weld deposits. The small diameter wires, such as .045 & 1/16"" diameters can be used out-of-position. The arc characteristics are globular but can be improved with the use of argon mixes. Dual Shield T-5 is recommended for medium to heavy fabrication of many mild steels where superior toughness and crack resistance are required. It is a good choice for mild steel or when being joined to quenched and tempered low alloy high strength steels. The weld metal analysis is similar to an E7018 or E7018-1 low hydrogen electrode.","Industries,Welding Process","Civil Construction,Railcars,Mobile Equipment,Industrial and General Fabrication,Welding-FCAW - Flux Core Arc Welding","Typical Tensile Properties,75% Ar - 25% CO,Condition,Elongation,Reduction in Area,Stress Relieved Temperature,Stress Relieved Testing Time,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,Typical Charpy V-Notch Properties,75% Ar - 25% CO,Condition,Impact Value,Stress Relieved Testing Temp,Stress Relieved Testing Time,Testing Temperature,Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,P,Mn,C,S,Si,P,Mn,C,S,Si,Deposition Data,75% Ar - 25% CO,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Deposition Type,Efficiency (%),TTW Dist.,Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Approvals: ,Classifications: ","

"DUAL,SHIELD,II,70-Ni1,H4",Gas Shielded Flux Cored Wires (FCAW),Mild Steel Wires,"Dual Shield II 70-Ni1 H4 is an all-position, flux-cored wire designed to be used under 75% Ar/25% CO, gas protection. It provides excellent low temperature toughness in both as-welded or stress-relieved conditions. Dual Shield II 70-Ni1 H4 produces low diffusible Hydrogen levels – lower than 4ml/100g – over a wide range of welding parameters. The smooth arc, fast-freezing slag, low spatter levels and easy slag release make this an ideal wire for the welding of steel plate in all positions. Nickel content below 1% and Brinell hardness less than 200 meet the requirements for applications where resistance to stress-corrosion cracking is required. Dual Shield II 70-Ni1 H4 is used in the fabrication of storage vessels that need to be stress relieved to minimize the ocurrance of stress corrosion cracking (SCC).

"DUAL,SHIELD,8000-NI2",Gas Shielded Flux Cored Wires (FCAW),Mild Steel Wires,"Dual Shield 8000-Ni2 is an all-position flux cored electrode that deposits 2.5% Ni deposit with an 82 ksi (565 MPa) minimum tensile strength. Dual Shield 8000-Ni2 may be used with CO, or argon mixtures. The argon-CO, mixtures reduce spatter and further improve weldability especially for small vertical-up fillets. Dual Shield 8000-Ni2 produces superior weld metal properties which make it most desirable for such applications as shipbuilding and heavy machinery construction. The weld metal analysis is similar to an E8018-C1 low hydrogen electrode.","Industries,Welding Process","Mobile Equipment,Industrial and General Fabrication,Bridge Construction,Process,Welding-FCAW - Flux Core Arc Welding","Typical Tensile Properties,75% Ar - 25% CO,Condition,Elongation,Reduction in Area,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,100% CO,Condition,Elongation,Reduction in Area,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,Typical Charpy V-Notch Properties,75% Ar - 25% CO,Condition,Impact Value,Testing Temperature,100% CO,Condition,Impact Value,Testing Temperature,75% Ar - 25% CO,Condition,Impact Value,Testing Temperature,Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,P,Mn,S,C,Si,Ni,P,Mn,S,C,Si,Ni,Deposition Data,Diameter,Current,Deposition Rate,Efficiency (%),Voltage,Wire Feed Speed,Approvals: ,Classifications: ","

"OK,61.85",Covered (Stick) Electrodes (SMAW),Stainless Steel Wires,OK 61.85 is a basic Nb-stabilized electrode designed for welding of Nb- or Ti-stabilized stainless steels of the 19Cr10Ni-type. It has very good resistance against intergranular corrosion. OK 61.85 provides the best hot cracking resistance of the E347 type electrodes due to the combination of the high ferrite content level and the basic coating. Ferrite may transform to brittle phases at elevated temperatures. To avoid excessive embrittlement of the welds the maximum working temperature is limited to 400°C.,,,"Typical Tensile Properties,ISO,Elongation,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,Stress Relieved Temperature,Stress Relieved Testing Time,ISO,Elongation,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,Stress Relieved Temperature,Stress Relieved Testing Time,AWS,Elongation,Tensile Strength,Yield Strength,Stress Relieved Temperature,Stress Relieved Testing Time,Typical Charpy V-Notch Properties,ISO,Impact Value,Testing Temperature,Stress Relieved Testing Temp,Stress Relieved Testing Time,ISO,Impact Value,Testing Temperature,Stress Relieved Testing Temp,Stress Relieved Testing Time,Typical Weld Metal Analysis %,Mn,C,Nb,Si,Ferrite  FN,Ni,N,Cr,Deposition Data,Diameter,Burn-off Time/Electrode,Current,Deposition Rate,Number of Electrodes/Weld Metal,Voltage,Weld Metal/Electrodes Weight,Approvals: ,Classifications: ,Alloy Type: ,Coating Type: ,Ferrite Content: ,Welding Current: ","

Refrac-T-Back,Cermic Backup Tape,All, ,,"Individually sized and cut to a specific length, these disposable tiles are flexible and easily adaptable to many different weld configurations. The cost savings potential makes this an attractive alternative to arc gouging and rewelding full penetration welds.,The composition of this non-metallic material is an ideal alternative to steel or copper backing bars. The quality and consistency within the ceramic composition eliminates any concern for metallurgical mismatch in either the base material or weld metal. The density of such a material not only helps support and define the molten weld metal, but more importantly, effectively resists moisture pick-up that can seriously affect the weld deposit.",,
